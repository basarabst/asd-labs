# About

This repository contains some implementations of a recursive function to compute an elementary function given by a variant.

- Recursive descent: `1-descent.c`

- Recursive back: `2-back.c`

- Recursive mixed (descent + back): `3-mixed.c`

>**Note:** All these algorithms calculate the elementary function with some observational error. A graph of this observational error was plotted, depending on the input data.

## Testing

Testing was successful. All calculated values coincided in all cases. For verification, a cyclic program `loop.c` was written, which also showed an identical result. For greater accuracy, a check on a calculator was used.
